Capabilities are not binary; they evolve through stages of **academic maturity**.

> **Foundation** (Understanding concepts) → **Applied** (Using tools in context) → **Advanced** (Complex synthesis) → **Evidence** (Production & Portfolio)

## Maturity stages (definition)

| Stage | What it means | Typical signals | Evidence examples |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation | Understands core concepts and vocabulary. | Correct explanations, clear definitions, basic reasoning. | Short concept memo, annotated examples, foundational quiz + reflection. |
| Applied | Uses methods and tools in context with guidance. | Working solutions for scoped problems, basic validation. | Small project repo, notebook with results, structured lab report. |
| Advanced | Synthesizes multiple ideas under constraints. | Tradeoffs, architecture decisions, handling edge cases. | Design review, system diagram + rationale, comparative evaluation. |
| Evidence | Produces portfolio-ready artifacts that stand up to review. | Reproducibility, documentation, audit trail, reflection. | Portfolio entry, publishable report, capstone-quality repository. |

## How to read this progression (for students)

Use this page as a guide to understand what “growth” looks like in Atlantis Nexus.

- **Foundation** means you can explain core concepts and use the right language.
    - Focus on clarity: definitions, examples, and correct reasoning.
- **Applied** means you can use methods and tools to solve scoped problems.
    - Focus on doing: working outputs, basic validation, and documented steps.
- **Advanced** means you can synthesize and make decisions under constraints.
    - Focus on tradeoffs: architecture choices, edge cases, and justified decisions.
- **Evidence** means you can produce portfolio-ready work that stands up to review.
    - Focus on auditability: reproducibility, documentation, and reflection.

### What to aim for in your work

- Treat every assignment as an opportunity to produce an **artifact** you can reuse.
- Make your work easy to review: include **assumptions**, **methods**, **results**, and **limitations**.
- Keep a simple portfolio trail: collect your best artifacts and add a short reflection on what you learned.
