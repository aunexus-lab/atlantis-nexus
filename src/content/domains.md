### **Purpose**

The **Technology Paths Inventory** defines the **academic capability landscape** that Atlantis Nexus supports across programs at **Atlantis University**.

This inventory intentionally precedes any platform selection. Its purpose is to:

- Identify **what academic capabilities are required**, independent of tools
- Clarify **how different disciplines use technology differently**
- Prevent vendor-driven fragmentation or duplication
- Enable intentional mapping to one or more platforms *after* academic alignment

> Atlantis Nexus adopts capabilities first, platforms second. Technology paths describe **patterns of academic use**, not software stacks.

### **Core Academic Capability Domains**

Atlantis Nexus recognizes the following **cross-program capability domains**:

1. **Cognitive Architecture**
2. **Data Engineering**
3. **Digital Ethics**
4. **Systems Thinking**
5. **Human-Computer Interaction**
6. **Computational Logic**
7. **Adaptive Infrastructure**

Each program emphasizes these domains differently, resulting in **distinct Technology Paths**.
