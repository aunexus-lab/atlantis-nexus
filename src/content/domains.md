### **Purpose**

The **Technology Paths Inventory** defines the **academic capability landscape** that Atlantis Nexus supports across programs at **Atlantis University**.

This inventory intentionally precedes any platform selection. Its purpose is to:

- Identify **what academic capabilities are required**, independent of tools
- Clarify **how different disciplines use technology differently**
- Prevent vendor-driven fragmentation or duplication
- Enable intentional mapping to one or more platforms *after* academic alignment

> Atlantis Nexus adopts capabilities first, platforms second. Technology paths describe **patterns of academic use**, not software stacks.

### **Core Academic Capability Domains**

Atlantis Nexus recognizes the following **cross-program capability domains**:

1. Academic identity and access
2. Knowledge creation and collaboration
3. Data and information handling
4. Analysis, modeling, and visualization
5. Automation and workflow reasoning
6. Applied artificial intelligence
7. Evidence, portfolio, and assessment

Each program emphasizes these domains differently, resulting in **distinct Technology Paths**.
